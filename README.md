# Who is Simon?
When Simon isn’t busy teaching machines to outsmart themselves, he’s probably serenading his neighbours (sorry) or chasing a challenge that most people would call “a questionable life choice.” His guitar? Practically a fifth limb—he’s had it since age five and honestly treats it better than his laptop (which, as a CS person, says a lot).

He cares about people so much that, try as he might to play it cool, he just can’t help stepping in whenever someone needs a hand.

And yes, Simon is writing this in third person because he read somewhere it boosts credibility. Or maybe he just thinks it sounds cooler. The world may never know.

Hey I'm Simon,

I've been doing a lot in machine learning recently whenever I've had time. I'm just now getting into some Kaggle datascience competetions and hope that's going to improve my skills.
I'm currently great at Python, and the basics of web development but I've been gradually learning Rust and Typescript.
I currently use VS Code and Pycharm depending on the task and am starting to get comfortable with Vim Motions.
When I'm not coding you'll find me playing tennis, working out, taking care of my dog, spending time with friends and family, and doing some mental health stuff.

Love to connect!
